A Bash Script combining very few selected, most used by me, command from ssh, scp and sshfs

## Requirements

You have to install these package both on your local and remote systems

> openssh

## How to use

```git clone https://github.com/gooosz/syncat.git```

```cd syncat```

and make the bash script executable by

```chmod +x syncat```

now create a symlink to the script in your /usr/bin

```ln -s syncat /usr/bin/syncat```

## Tips

It is recommended to enable passwordless ssh for both machines
